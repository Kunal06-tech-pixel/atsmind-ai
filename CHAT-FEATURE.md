## Example Conversation

**User:** "How can I improve my ATS score?"

**AI:** "Your current ATS score is 53/100 (Medium level). Here are specific ways to improve:

1. **Add Missing Skills**: Your analysis shows you're missing PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Docker. Adding these to your skills section could boost your score significantly.

2. **Strengthen Experience Section**: Your experience analysis indicates you should add more measurable impacts. Use numbers and percentages to quantify your achievements.

3. **Address Weaknesses**: The analysis identified that you need to demonstrate Agile/Scrum experience. Consider adding any sprint work or team collaboration examples.

Your local score breakdown shows which skill, semantic, keyword, and resume-quality signals need improvement. Focus on the missing skills and suggestions above to reach a High score (75+)."
